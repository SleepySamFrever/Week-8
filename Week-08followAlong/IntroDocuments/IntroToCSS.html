<!--CSS (Cascading Style Sheets allows us to add style to our application and make it look modern-->
<!--With CSS we can select certain HTML elements and define how they should be displayed using key value paired properties-->
<!--These properties define different aspects of how an element is displayed i.e. color, size, and border style-->

<!--The practice of adding CSS in the "style" attribute of an HTML element is known as "in-line" CSS because it is written "in line" with the HTML
    This is a good way to quickly test a style, but it's not a good idea to cread your pages with in-line CSS because it becomes difficult to manage.
    
    Example: Everytime you'd need to make a change, you'd need to do it "in-line". Tedious and prone to human error.-->

<!--A better way to add CSS to your HTML is using "internal CSS" as opposed to "in-line CSS"-->

<!--Internal CSS allows us to write all our CSS in one place within each HTML document.
That place is inside a style element in the head.

Because the CSS isn't in-line with the HTML elements it will be styling we can use "selectors" to determine which elements the CSS will applyh to-->

<!--Some "Selectors" we have include the body(element or tag selector), class, or i.d.-->
